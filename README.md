# 🛠️ **Configuring Domain User Password Policy**  

This document provides an overview of how to configure password policies for domain user accounts in a Windows environment using Group Policy Management.

---

## 🚀 **Accessing Group Policy Management**  

1. Open the **Group Policy Management** console by navigating to **Tools** > **Group Policy Management**.  
2. In the left pane, **right-click** on the **Default Domain Policy** and select **Edit**.  
3. Navigate to:  
   `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy`.

## 🔑 **Password Policy Settings**

### 1. **🔒 Enforce Password History**  
This setting ensures that users cannot reuse old passwords too frequently. It defines the number of unique new passwords that must be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused.  
- **Range**: 0 to 24 passwords.  
- **Default**:  
  - **24** on domain controllers.  
  - **0** on stand-alone servers.  
- **Recommendation**: To enforce password history effectively, enable the **Minimum Password Age** policy. This prevents users from cycling through passwords quickly.

---

### 2. **📅 Maximum Password Age**  
This policy sets the maximum period a password can be used before the system requires a change.  
- **Range**: 1 to 999 days (or set to 0 for no expiration).  
- **Best Practice**: Set password expiration to 30–90 days to limit the risk of unauthorized access.  
- **Default**: **42 days** on domain controllers.

---

### 3. **⏳ Minimum Password Age**  
This setting defines the minimum period a password must be used before the user can change it. This prevents users from changing passwords repeatedly to bypass other password policies.  
- **Range**: 1 to 998 days (or set to 0 for no restriction).  
- **Default**:  
  - **1** on domain controllers.  
  - **0** on stand-alone servers.  
- **Tip**: To ensure password history enforcement works, configure a minimum password age greater than 0.

---

### 4. **🔢 Minimum Password Length**  
This policy determines the minimum number of characters for a user’s password.  
- **Range**: 1 to 14 characters (or set to 0 to allow no password).  
- **Default**:  
  - **7** on domain controllers.  
  - **0** on stand-alone servers.

---

### 5. **⚙️ Password Complexity Requirements**  
When enabled, this setting enforces the following complexity requirements:  
- Passwords must contain at least **six characters**.  
- Passwords must include characters from at least **three of the following categories**:  
  - Uppercase English letters (A-Z)  
  - Lowercase English letters (a-z)  
  - Base-10 digits (0-9)  
  - Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., !, $, #, %)  
- **Default**: Enabled on domain controllers, disabled on stand-alone servers.

---

### 6. **🛑 Store Passwords Using Reversible Encryption**  
This setting controls whether passwords are stored using reversible encryption, which is a less secure method. It should only be enabled if absolutely necessary for specific applications.  
- **Default**: Disabled.

---

### 7. **🔐 Account Lockout Duration**  
This setting determines how long an account remains locked after reaching the account lockout threshold.  
- **Range**: 0 to 99,999 minutes (or set to 0 for manual unlocking).  
- **Default**: None (only applies when an account lockout threshold is defined).

---

### 8. **❌ Account Lockout Threshold**  
This policy determines how many failed login attempts result in an account being locked. Once locked, the account cannot be accessed until manually reset or until the lockout duration expires.  
- **Range**: 0 to 999 failed login attempts (set to 0 to disable lockout).  
- **Default**: **0** (no account lockout).

---

### 9. **⏲️ Reset Account Lockout Counter After**  
This setting defines the number of minutes that must pass after a failed login attempt before the failed attempt counter resets to 0.  
- **Range**: 1 minute to 99,999 minutes.  
- **Default**: None (only applies when an account lockout threshold is defined).

---

## 💡 **Best Practices**  
To enhance security, consider the following best practices:  
- Set **password expiration** between 30 and 90 days to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.  
- Enable **password complexity requirements** to ensure strong passwords.  
- Use **account lockout** policies to limit brute-force attacks.
